# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1alpha3Device from a JSON string
v1alpha3_device_instance = V1alpha3Device.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1alpha3Device.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1alpha3_device_dict = v1alpha3_device_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1alpha3Device from a dict
v1alpha3_device_from_dict = V1alpha3Device.from_dict(v1alpha3_device_dict)
