**device** | **str** | Device references one device instance via its name in the driver&#39;s resource pool. It must be a DNS label. | 
**driver** | **str** | Driver specifies the name of the DRA driver whose kubelet plugin should be invoked to process the allocation once the claim is needed on a node.  Must be a DNS subdomain and should end with a DNS domain owned by the vendor of the driver. | 
**pool** | **str** | This name together with the driver name and the device name field identify which device was allocated (&#x60;&lt;driver name&gt;/&lt;pool name&gt;/&lt;device name&gt;&#x60;).  Must not be longer than 253 characters and may contain one or more DNS sub-domains separated by slashes. |

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.v1alpha3_device_request_allocation_result import V1alpha3DeviceRequestAllocationResult

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1alpha3DeviceRequestAllocationResult from a JSON string
v1alpha3_device_request_allocation_result_instance = V1alpha3DeviceRequestAllocationResult.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1alpha3DeviceRequestAllocationResult.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1alpha3_device_request_allocation_result_dict = v1alpha3_device_request_allocation_result_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1alpha3DeviceRequestAllocationResult from a dict
v1alpha3_device_request_allocation_result_from_dict = V1alpha3DeviceRequestAllocationResult.from_dict(v1alpha3_device_request_allocation_result_dict)
