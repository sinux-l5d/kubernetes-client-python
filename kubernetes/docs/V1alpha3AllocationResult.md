# V1alpha3AllocationResult

AllocationResult contains attributes of an allocated resource.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**controller** | **str** | Controller is the name of the DRA driver which handled the allocation. That driver is also responsible for deallocating the claim. It is empty when the claim can be deallocated without involving a driver.  A driver may allocate devices provided by other drivers, so this driver name here can be different from the driver names listed for the results.  This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DRAControlPlaneController feature gate. | [optional] 
**devices** | [**V1alpha3DeviceAllocationResult**](V1alpha3DeviceAllocationResult.md) |  | [optional] 
**node_selector** | [**V1NodeSelector**](V1NodeSelector.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.v1alpha3_allocation_result import V1alpha3AllocationResult

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1alpha3AllocationResult from a JSON string
v1alpha3_allocation_result_instance = V1alpha3AllocationResult.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1alpha3AllocationResult.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1alpha3_allocation_result_dict = v1alpha3_allocation_result_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1alpha3AllocationResult from a dict
v1alpha3_allocation_result_from_dict = V1alpha3AllocationResult.from_dict(v1alpha3_allocation_result_dict)
